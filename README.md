# ORPHEUS

[简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

[Discord](https://discord.gg/tqukqjAk7)

ORPHEUS is an open-source server reimplementation for **Overwatch 1 retail 1.74.0.0.104319**. It is an independent, unofficial research and game preservation project. The long-term goal is to reproduce the server behavior and client-facing events for this build across its heroes, maps and modes. The server is still in development, with Soldier: 76 in the Practice Range as the first end-to-end target.

This branch contains the Rust server. The [default branch](https://github.com/leafall903/ORPHEUS/tree/main) contains the community-maintained Python server.

## Current status

| Area | Implemented and tested on the server | Evidence from the original client and remaining work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local login and lobby | Local authentication emulation, lobby, hero selection and match handoff. Automated checks cover handshake and server startup with prepared data. | Login, Practice Range loading and hero selection or switching have been observed. Broader lobby flows and match rules need verification. |
| Soldier: 76 | Body and weapon state, movement and Sprint, rifle fire and reload, Helix Rockets and Biotic Field. Automated tests cover selected scenarios including repeated switching and rejoining, lost packets, and ammunition state. | The tester has fired on and killed training bots. Stable weapon presentation, ammunition HUD, input response and ability behavior still need a complete client pass. |
| Practice Range combat | Hit and damage resolution, bot health, death and respawn, and replication of the original overhead health display graph for stock bots. Automated tests use controlled fixtures and prepared collision from the target map. | The tester has reported missing overhead health bars, unnamed eliminations, missing kill feed and missing headshot audio. The display graph change has wire evidence. Its rendering still needs a documented client result. |
| Networking and research | Encrypted UDP, player input, entity lifecycles, server snapshots, replay and selected loss/reorder checks. | Client prediction, combat feedback, two-client agreement, longer sessions and broader map behavior remain open. |
| Heroes, modes and audio | Shared systems and partial coverage exist. | Full hero abilities, objectives, match flow, hit and multikill feedback, and contextual voice playback are still in development. |

An automated result covers the fixture or replay named in its evidence. A manual observation covers the build, commit and steps that were actually tried. No complete original-client acceptance pass has been recorded for the first target scenario. See the [verification record](docs/STATE.md) and [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

## Get involved

- **Developers and AI-assisted contributors** can start with the public source tests. The guide covers Codex, Claude Code and the same review requirements for all submissions. [Contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)
- **Reverse engineers** can help pin a single field, state transition, event or timing rule to build 104319. Start with the relevant evidence and report uncertainty explicitly. [Research evidence](docs/RESEARCH_EVIDENCE.txt)
- **Players** with the target client and authorized runtime can report a short, repeatable gameplay result. Reports of working behavior are welcome alongside bugs. [Gameplay verification](https://github.com/leafall903/ORPHEUS/issues/new?template=gameplay-verification.yml)
- **New contributors** can look for tasks that use the public checkout and synthetic data. [Good first issues](https://github.com/leafall903/ORPHEUS/labels/good%20first%20issue)

## Run locally

The experimental `orpheus_server` binary runs the local Battle.net, lobby and UDP services together. Headless tests cover encrypted login with a saved profile, solo Practice Range loading, world creation, bot movement, hero selection and body replacement with the base graph bundle. The worker simulates ordinary player movement on prepared collision and bounds input catch-up across peers. Separate reference checks cover lobby content, logical button input, timed script events and the isolated Soldier: 76 Sprint graph. Live hero-script movement, owner corrections, full bot behavior and combat are still being ported. Run `cargo test --locked --all-targets` with stable Rust to verify the public fixtures. New work goes into Rust. The frozen Python server remains the regular entry point until cutover.

Rust runs the authored Soldier rifle, reload and Helix cooldown timelines in reference tests. A separate fixture weapon runs through the encrypted Practice Range worker and verifies hit delivery, packet loss recovery and bot respawn. Projectile flight and prediction records have separate tests. In the original-client Rust playtest, the user could enter Practice Range but reported missing weapons and unusable abilities. The stock Soldier body still needs more graph support. Gallery equip and in-match skin replacement now pass encrypted loopback checks and await a client retest.

Bot movement, colliders, health, rewind and respawn state share a body entity in the room's Bevy ECS storage. The Lua patrol pilot handles spawn waits, route choices and movement-release waits. Rust still runs collision, movement and network delivery. [Architecture and migration gates](docs/NATIVE_SERVER_ARCHITECTURE.md).

The documented environment is Windows with Python 3.12. Node.js 24 is used for the dashboard test. The public source checks can run without the game or any prepared runtime.

```powershell
py -3.12 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt "ruff==0.17.3"
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -B -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_game_commands.py
```

See the [full list of public checks](CONTRIBUTING.md#public-source-checks) before running broader test discovery.

### Separate deployment data

To run the local server, set `ORPHEUS_RUNTIME_DIR` to a prepared, authorized runtime for build 104319. The runtime includes protocol data, graphs, lobby signing input and collision caches. A copy of the game client alone cannot supply all inputs to the preparation tool.

```powershell
cargo run --locked --bin prepare_server_runtime -- --source 'C:\path\to\local-research' --destination 'C:\path\to\orpheus-runtime' --map 0688
$env:ORPHEUS_RUNTIME_DIR = 'C:\path\to\orpheus-runtime'
cargo run --locked --bin orpheus_server -- --data-dir 'C:\path\to\local-state'
```

The preparation command copies files from an already prepared checkout and writes a manifest. Omit `--map` to copy all available prepared caches. The native server listens on loopback and can run without a game installation or relay DLL. It reads `profiles/`, `profile.json` and `default_account.txt` from the local state directory. To reuse saved profiles, point it at the existing state directory and use one server at a time. See [Rust migration](docs/RUST_MIGRATION.md) and [runtime data provenance](data/README.md).

Append `--debug-port 3726` to enable the read-only inspector, then visit [the local dashboard](http://127.0.0.1:3726/). It shows active actors and the prepared Practice Range collision layers. Use a room actor or enter XYZ coordinates to inspect a smaller region. The spawn sample is available while the server is idle. [Inspector details](docs/NATIVE_SERVER_ARCHITECTURE.md#collision-and-live-inspection).
