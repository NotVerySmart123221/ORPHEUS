"""The training bots: what a map's AI spawners make (data/ai_spawners_174.json, made by
tools/extract_ai_spawners.py from each map's ENTITY chunk).

The Practice Range has 15 spawners: 11 Training Bots on the red team and 4 Friendly Bots on the blue one
(retail's OW2 Practice Range showed 15 bots too, each with a movement record in every frame, idle or not). A
spawner names a hero, a team and the graphs that drive the bot:

- 0B8E walks a route. Its variable 6947 lists AI hint points, variable 39 is the route index (2 to start).
  It waits 2 s, then 1 s (two StateWaits), sets #39 = (#39 + 1) % count(#6947), and walks to the point
  #6947[#39] (STU_ECAEE401 with the move-to 194D744E and the face-to AB9B30EF); after a walk it waits 1 s
  (the second wait) and goes on.
- 0B92 alternates firing and waiting phases of 1.75 to 2.5 s within 0.4 m of spawn, and walks back when
  displaced. Its 0013.025 reset branch delays firing eligibility by 2.75 s. The server advances the
  weapon body and its volleys. Production AI selection and input delivery still need the native hooks.
- No graph: the bot stands.

A bot is a hero body without a player: the hero's m_gameplayEntity, its health (the body's override of
the common body graph 0033's variable 199: Training Bots 200, Friendly Bots 225), the team and the hero, as
a player's body (match.Match._bot_create). The server moves it itself and sends its state as another
player's body's. The client's code for the AI's move-to, face-to and fire states is a stub (one shared
class, vtable 0x7FF78B6BC800): they ran on the server only.

How it walks was measured on the retail OW2 Practice Range (its live traffic), whose four
walking bots walk the far routes of these spawners (MEASURED unless marked):
- It sets off when its wait ends, whichever way it faces (backward or sideways at first), its keys held
  all the way (throttles of 127), and turns toward the way it walks at 60 degrees a second (TURN_RATE)
  until 0.5 s after it lets go of the keys (TURN_AFTER).
- It speeds up at its body's ground acceleration times run speed to its run speed, and lets go of the
  keys where its ground friction (base times run speed) stops it on its point: 4.5 m/s^2, 4.5 m/s and
  67.5 m/s^2, the Training Bot body's values (DATA: data/game_movers_174.json, 1403). On a ramp its speed
  is along the floor.
- The next walk starts WALK_GAP after the last tick with keys (the graph's 1 s wait and its state
  changes); the first one FIRST_WAIT after it spawns (DATA, not in the captures).
- unverified: it stops on its point. Retail stopped 0.05-0.45 m short of the 1.74 points, but its own points
  may be as far from them.
- The far runners (hero 016E) walk with their own body 14ED's values (DATA, 1.74): 6 m/s, up at 66 m/s^2
  (ground acceleration 11), down at 39 m/s^2 (friction base 6.5), the fast targets 1.74 made them. OW2
  put ordinary Training Bots on these routes (4.5 m/s); the server keeps 1.74's. The routes are 1.74's
  (DATA); OW2 changed three of them.
It follows the floor and sweeps its standing capsule through the same static collision as players.
For a blocked straight leg, it tries another authored hint, then a short lateral detour along
the same floor. The original server's navigation is unverified. When no floor can be sampled,
its requested feet height follows the line between its last point and the next one.
